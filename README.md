# Tic-tac-toe

This repository contains a Python tic-tac-toe game that can be played via 
console/terminal. 

#### How to play

Clone the remote repository:

`git clone https://github.com/tuliorc/tictactoe.git`


Go into your new local repository:

`cd tictactoe`


Make sure you have Python3 installed in your computer:

`python3`

In case you don't, install it:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install python3.6`

Execute the main script:

`python3 tictactoe.py`


#### Tips
* Always type in numbers between 1 and 9. They correspond to each of the 
positions of the tictactoe board, i.e., the number 1 corresponds to the 
first column and first row in the board, while the number 9 corresponds to 
the third column and third row. 
* If you try to type in something else besides an integer between 1 and 9, 
you'll be asked to try another input.
* When the game is finished, you'll be asked to play again. Type "yes" to do
 so or anything else to quit the game and get the final scores!
* Invite your friends and enjoy this simple but yet very traditional game! :)
